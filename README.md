## Template Instructions

Welcome,

This is the Code Institute student template for the Heritage Housing project option in Predictive Analytics. We have preinstalled all of the tools you need to get started. It's perfectly ok to use this template as the basis for your project submissions. Click the `Use this template` button above to get started.

You can safely delete the Template Instructions section of this README.md file,  and modify the remaining paragraphs for your own project. Please do read the Template Instructions at least once, though! It contains some important information about the IDE and the extensions we use.

## How to use this repo

1. Use this template to create your GitHub project repo

2. Log into the cloud-based IDE with your GitHub account.

3. On your Dashboard, click on the Create button

4. Paste in the URL you copied from GitHub earlier

5. Click Create

6. Wait for the workspace to open. This can take a few minutes.

7. Open a new terminal and `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

11. Open the jupyter_notebooks directory and click on the notebook you want to open.

12. Click the kernel button and choose Python Environments.

Note that the kernel says Python 3.8.18 as it inherits from the workspace so it will be Python-3.8.18 as installed by our template. To confirm this you can use `! python --version` in a notebook code cell.

## Cloud IDE Reminders

To log into the Heroku toolbelt CLI:

1. Log in to your Heroku account and go to *Account Settings* in the menu under your avatar.
2. Scroll down to the *API Key* and click *Reveal*
3. Copy the key
4. In your Cloud IDE, from the terminal, run `heroku_config`
5. Paste in your API key when asked

You can now use the `heroku` CLI program - try running `heroku apps` to confirm it works. This API key is unique and private to you so do not share it. If you accidentally make it public then you can create a new one with *Regenerate API Key*.

## Dataset Content

* The dataset is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/codeinstitute/housing-prices-data). We then created a fictitious user story where predictive analytics can be applied in a real project in the workplace.
* The dataset has almost 1.5 thousand rows and represents housing records from Ames, Iowa, indicating house profile (Floor Area, Basement, Garage, Kitchen, Lot, Porch, Wood Deck, Year Built) and its respective sale price for houses built between 1872 and 2010.

## Business Requirement 1: Data Visualization and Correlation

- Lydia wants to understand the key factors that influence house prices in Ames, Iowa.
- To achieve this, we will conduct data visualization and a correlation analysis to identify which variables have the strongest impact on the sale price.
- This requirement involves creating visualizations such as scatter plots, bar charts, and heatmaps that show the relationship between attributes like house size, year built, and lot size, and their correlation with sales price.

## Business Requirement 2: Price Prediction Using Machine Learning

- Lydia needs a machine learning model to accurately predict the sales prices of her inherited properties.
- We will use a regression model to estimate the sale price of the houses based on their features, such as lot area, number of rooms, year built, and garage area.
- Additionally, we will create a dashboard that allows Lydia to easily input property characteristics and receive price predictions, as well as explore the insights obtained from the analysis and model.

## Hypothesis and how to validate?

1. Lot Size and Property Size Correlate with Price: Our first hypothesis is that both property size and lot size have a strong correlation with the sales price. Larger properties and lots are likely to be more valuable due to their potential use and space.

2. Kitchen Quality Correlates with Price: We hypothesize that houses with higher kitchen quality (rated as Excellent or Good) will have a higher sales price compared to houses with lower kitchen quality, as kitchen quality is often a major factor in buyer preference.

3. Year Built Correlates with Price: We believe that houses built more recently will have a higher sales price compared to older houses. Newer construction is expected to have modern standards and less need for renovations, making them more attractive to buyers.

4. We hypothesize that houses with larger garage areas are likely to have higher sales prices. A larger garage provides additional space for parking and storage, which can increase the overall attractiveness and value of the property.

## The rationale to map the business requirements to the Data Visualisations and ML tasks

* List your business requirements and a rationale to map them to the Data Visualisations and ML tasks.

## ML Business Case

* In the previous bullet, you potentially visualised an ML task to answer a business requirement. You should frame the business case using the method we covered in the course.

## Dashboard Design

* List all dashboard pages and their content, either blocks of information or widgets, like buttons, checkboxes, images, or any other items that your dashboard library supports.
* Eventually, during the project development, you may revisit your dashboard plan to update a given feature (for example, at the beginning of the project you were confident you would use a given plot to display an insight but eventually you needed to use another plot type)

## Unfixed Bugs

* You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not valid reason to leave bugs unfixed.

## Deployment

### Heroku

* The App live link is: <https://YOUR_APP_NAME.herokuapp.com/>
* Set the runtime.txt Python version to a [Heroku-20](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/python-support#supported-runtimes) stack currently supported version.
* The project was deployed to Heroku using the following steps.

1. Log in to Heroku and create an App
2. At the Deploy tab, select GitHub as the deployment method.
3. Select your repository name and click Search. Once it is found, click Connect.
4. Select the branch you want to deploy, then click Deploy Branch.
5. The deployment process should happen smoothly if all deployment files are fully functional. Click the button Open App on the top of the page to access your App.
6. If the slug size is too large then add large files not required for the app to the .slugignore file.

## Main Data Analysis and Machine Learning Libraries

* Here you should list the libraries you used in the project and provide example(s) of how you used these libraries.

## Credits

* In this section, you need to reference where you got your content, media and extra help from. It is common practice to use code from other repositories and tutorials, however, it is important to be very specific about these sources to avoid plagiarism.
* You can break the credits section up into Content and Media, depending on what you have included in your project.
